# Renewable Energy Worldwide Project:
Summary
-  Harnessing Data for a Sustainable Future: Analysing Global Trends in Renewable Energy from 2000 to 2020 (20 years data).
  
-  Hypothesis 1: Are the G20 countries leading in the renewable energy worldwide in comparison with the other countries that contribute to the global renewable energy landscape?
  
-  Hypothesis 2: Countries with higher investment in renewable energy capacity (wind, solar, hydro, geothermal) have achieved greater energy independence, reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels.
  
-  In a team of 4, we utilized SQL (Google BigQuery), Python (Google Colab), Microsoft Power BI, DBT, Google Sheet, Microsoft Excel, GitHub, Notion, Google Docs, Kanban(Trello) and Product-Based (Agile) methodology for this project.
  
-  In conclusion, analysis showed that Non-G20 countries contribute significantly to renewable energy production and more than G20 countries; however the G20 countries consumes renewable energy more than the Non-G20 countries. This analysis and the conclusion thereon is limited to the data range stated above.
